Project template for wq framework
================================

This is the recommended Django project template for projects utilizing the [wq framework], with [wq.app] for the front end and [wq.db] as the backend component.

### Usage

```sh
pip3 install wq
wq-start <projectname> [directory]
```

### Rationale

This template is also useful as an example of how to build a web app with [RequireJS] and a [Django REST Framework] backend.  It differs from the default Django project template in a few key ways:

 * A default Apache2 WSGI configuration is included in `conf/`
 * All static files are kept in the `app/` folder, with the idea that they will be built with a RequireJS-powered [build process].  This clean separation between the front end and backend components makes it easier to wrap the front end in [PhoneGap] for release on app stores.
 * Because of this separation, the root of the Django project is in `db/` rather than at the top level of the project.  `db/` is included on the Python path in the Apache config (and implicitly when running `./manage.py`).
 * Mustache templates are kept at the top level, because they are [shared between the client and the server](http://wq.io/docs/templates).
